# Optimising Basketball 
## Realtime analysis of basketball with machine learning

### Tech Used
- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for writing the python
- [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org)  for custom linear model
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) for building image models
- [TensorFlow.js](https://tensorflow.org/js/) for productionising models to web

the 3 interesting notebooks:

[Frame_trails.ipynb](prototype_work/image_trail_v2.ipynb) - where I extract data points from a video file.

[Trajectory_fitting.ipynb](prototype_work/Trajectory_fitting.ipynb) - where I use Tensorflow to fit a trajectory function to the data points extracted.

[Eager_optimising_basketball_shot.ipynb](prototype_work/Eager_optimising_basketball_shot.ipynb) - Using new Eager syntax to do the same task, make ploting data alot easier.
